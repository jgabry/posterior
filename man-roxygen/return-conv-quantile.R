#' @return
#' A numeric vector with one element per quantile. If any of the draws is
#' non-finite, that is, `NA`, `NaN`, `Inf`, or `-Inf`, the returned output will
#' be a vector of (numeric) `NA` values. Also, if all draws of a variable are
#' the same (constant), the returned output will be a vector of (numeric) `NA`
#' values as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant draws, we
#' cannot distinguish between variables that are supposed to be constant (e.g.,
#' a diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or variables that
#' just happened to be constant because of a failure of convergence or other
#' problems in the sampling process.

#' @param dimnames (list) Character vectors giving the names in each dimension
#'   to override the names of the dimensions of the [`rvar`] to be created (see
#'   [dimnames()]). If `NULL` (the default), this is determined by the input.
#'   **NOTE:** This argument controls the names of the dimensions of the
#'   [`rvar`], not the underlying array.

\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{draws} object, or another \R object for which the method is defined.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).}
}
\description{
Order \code{\link{draws}} objects according to iteration and chain number. By default,
draws objects are ordered but subsetting or extracting parts of them may
leave them in an unordered state.
}
\examples{
x <- as_draws_array(example_draws())
# manually select some iterations and chains
(x <- x[10:5, 4:3, ])
# reorder iteration and chain indices
order_draws(x)

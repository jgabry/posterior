\title{Tail effective sample size (tail-ESS)}
\usage{
ess_tail(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains) for a single variable.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value. If any of the draws is non-finite, that is, \code{NA},
\code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if
all draws of a variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be
(numeric) \code{NA} as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant
draws, we cannot distinguish between variables that are supposed to be
constant (e.g.,  a diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or
variables that just happened to be constant because of a failure of
convergence or other problems in the sampling process.
}
\description{
Compute a tail effective sample size estimate (tail-ESS) for a single
variable. Tail-ESS is useful as a diagnostic for the sampling efficiency in
the tails of the posterior. It is defined as the minimum of the effective
sample sizes for 5\% and 95\% quantiles. For the bulk effective sample
size see \code{\link[=ess_bulk]{ess_bulk()}}.

\examples{
mu <- extract_variable_matrix(example_draws(), "mu")

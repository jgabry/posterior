\title{Bulk effective sample size (bulk-ESS)}
\usage{
ess_bulk(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains) for a single variable.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value. If any of the draws is non-finite, that is, \code{NA},
\code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if
all draws of a variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be
(numeric) \code{NA} as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant
draws, we cannot distinguish between variables that are supposed to be
constant (e.g.,  a diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or
variables that just happened to be constant because of a failure of
convergence or other problems in the sampling process.
}
\description{
Compute a bulk effective sample size estimate (bulk-ESS) for a single
variable. Bulk-ESS is useful as a diagnostic for the sampling efficiency in
the bulk of the posterior. It is defined as the effective sample size for
rank normalized values using split chains. For the tail effective sample size
see \code{\link[=ess_tail]{ess_tail()}}.

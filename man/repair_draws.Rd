\usage{
repair_draws(x, order = TRUE, ...)

\method{repair_draws}{draws_matrix}(x, order = TRUE, ...)

\method{repair_draws}{draws_array}(x, order = TRUE, ...)

\method{repair_draws}{draws_df}(x, order = TRUE, ...)

\method{repair_draws}{draws_list}(x, order = TRUE, ...)

\method{repair_draws}{draws_rvar}(x, order = TRUE, ...)

\method{repair_draws}{rvar}(x, order = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{draws} object, or another \R object for which the method is defined.}

\item{order}{Logical; Indicates if draws should be ordered (via
\code{\link{order_draws}}) before repairing indices. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).}
}
\description{
Repair indices of \code{draws} objects so that iterations, chains, and draws
are continuously and consistently numbered.
}
\examples{
x <- as_draws_array(example_draws())
# manually select some iterations and chains
(x <- x[10:5, 3:4, ])
# repair iteration and chain indices
repair_draws(x)

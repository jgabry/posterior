\title{Get/set array of draws underlying a random variable}
\usage{
draws_of(x)

draws_of(x) <- value
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{(rvar) An \code{\link{rvar}} object.}

\item{value}{An array.}
}
\description{
Gets/sets the array-representation that backs an \code{\link{rvar}}. Should be used rarely.
}
\details{
While \code{\link{rvar}}s implement fast versions of basic math operations (including
\link[=rvar-matmult]{matrix multiplication}), sometimes you may need to bypass
the \code{\link{rvar}} abstraction to do what you need to do more efficiently.
\code{draws_of()} allows you to get / set the underlying array of draws in
order to do that.

\code{\link{rvar}}s represent draws internally using arrays of arbitrary dimension, which
is returned by \code{draws_of(x)} and can be set using \code{draws_of(x) <- value}.
The \strong{first} dimension of these arrays is the index of the draws.

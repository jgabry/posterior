\title{Bind \code{draws} objects together}
\usage{
bind_draws(x, ...)

\method{bind_draws}{draws_matrix}(x, ..., along = "variable")

\method{bind_draws}{draws_array}(x, ..., along = "variable")

\method{bind_draws}{draws_df}(x, ..., along = "variable")

\method{bind_draws}{draws_list}(x, ..., along = "variable")

\method{bind_draws}{draws_rvars}(x, ..., along = "variable")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\link{draws}} object. The draws format of \code{x} will define the format
of the returned draws object.}

\item{...}{Additional \code{\link{draws}} objects to bind to \code{x}.}

\item{along}{The dimension along which draws objects should be bound
together. Possible values are \code{"variable"} (the default), \code{"chain"},
\code{"iteration"}, and \code{"draw"}. Not all options are supported for all input
formats.}
}
\value{
A \code{draws} object of the same class as \code{x}.
}
\description{
Bind multiple \code{\link{draws}} objects together to form a single \code{draws} object.

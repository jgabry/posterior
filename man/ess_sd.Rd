\title{Effective sample size for the standard deviation}
\usage{
ess_sd(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains) for a single variable.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value. If any of the draws is non-finite, that is, \code{NA},
\code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if
all draws of a variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be
(numeric) \code{NA} as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant
draws, we cannot distinguish between variables that are supposed to be
constant (e.g.,  a diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or
variables that just happened to be constant because of a failure of
convergence or other problems in the sampling process.
}
\description{
Compute an effective sample size estimate for the standard deviation (SD)
estimate of a single variable. This is defined as minimum of the effective
sample size estimate for the mean and the the effective sample size estimate
for the mean of the squared value.

mu <- extract_variable_matrix(example_draws(), "mu")

\title{Rhat convergence diagnostic}
\usage{
rhat(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A 2D array of draws (iterations x chains) for a single variable.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value. If any of the draws is non-finite, that is, \code{NA},
\code{NaN}, \code{Inf}, or \code{-Inf}, the returned output will be (numeric) \code{NA}. Also, if
all draws of a variable are the same (constant), the returned output will be
(numeric) \code{NA} as well. The reason for the latter is that, for constant
draws, we cannot distinguish between variables that are supposed to be
constant (e.g.,  a diagonal element of a correlation matrix is always 1) or
variables that just happened to be constant because of a failure of
convergence or other problems in the sampling process.
}
\description{
Compute the Rhat convergence diagnostic for a single variable as the maximum
of rank normalized split-Rhat and rank normalized folded-split-Rhat as
proposed in Vehtari et al. (2019).

\examples{
mu <- extract_variable_matrix(example_draws(), "mu")
rhat(mu)

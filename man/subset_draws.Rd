\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{draws} object, or another \R object for which the method is defined.}

\item{...}{Arguments passed to individual methods (if applicable).}

\item{variable}{Character vector of variable names to be selected.
All elements of non-scalar variables can be selected at once.}

\item{iteration}{Numeric vector of iteration indices to be selected.}

\item{chain}{Numeric vector of chain indices to be selected.}

\item{draw}{Numeric vector of draw indices to be selected.
Subsetting draw indices will lead to an automatic merging of chains
via \code{\link{merge_chains}}.}

\item{regex}{Logical. Indicates whether \code{variable} should be treated as a
(vector of) regular expressions. Any variable in \code{x} matching at least one
of the regular expressions will be selected. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{unique}{Logical. Indicates whether duplicated selection of chains,
iterations, or draws is possible. If \code{TRUE} (the default) only
unique chains, iterations, and draws are selected regardless of how
often they appear in the respective selecting arguments.}
}
\value{
A \code{draws} object of the same class as \code{x}.
}
\description{
Subset \code{\link{draws}} objects by variables, iterations, chains, and draws indices.
}
\details{
To ensure that multiple consecutive subsetting operations work correctly,
\code{subset()} \emph{\link[=repair_draws]{repairs}} the \code{draws} object before and after
subsetting.
}
\examples{
x <- example_draws()
subset_draws(x, variable = c("mu", "tau"))
subset_draws(x, chain = 2)
subset_draws(x, iteration = 5:10, chain = 3:4)

# extract the first chain twice
subset_draws(x, chain = c(1, 1), unique = FALSE)

# extract all elements of 'theta'
subset_draws(x, variable = "theta")
